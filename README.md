# timeTravelTelevision

the time travel television is an old CRT television that lives at warren 77 - a sports bar in tribeca. 

this application, built in openframeworks 007 analyzes audio and video from an incoming digital cable signal. it looks for black frames and simultaneous silences that indicate cuts between programming and commercials.

when a game is being broadcast, the digital cable signal is passed to the television. when a commercial break is detected, however, we see vintage ads from the 1960s-90s starring new york sports legends.

the application works with a hardware controller that lets the bar owner play a vintage ad whenever they want to, regardless of the program, or bipass the software altogether.
